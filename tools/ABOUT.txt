-- Which these tools might you use if your program is crashing on specific user inputs and why?
I would use the vscode debugger because this will allow me to monitor variables at each step of the code. I would be able to see
where things are going wrong and set breakpoints where I think things would fail.


-- Which these tools might you use to determine how much of your code is tested by unit tests and why?
I would use gcov because it tells you the percentage of lines executed, so if you use it with a test file it will tell you everything
your tests cover.


-- What is a change you might make to address one of the issues in valgrind_vector_as_string.cpp?
I would change the loop indexing to not go out of bounds. It is a simple change that would just make things a lot easier.


============================================================

-- Did you use any external resources? If so, cite them below. If not, write no.
I used lecture code and slides to figure out how to use these debugger tools.


-- Did you use any LLM tools? If so, what tool, and what prompts did you provide?
n/a


-- If you used an LLM tool, write a sentence or two reflecting on your use of the tool. Some prompts that might help you think:
   -- Did the tool aid in my learning, or was it just a shortcut around challenges?
   -- With what I've learned, could I complete a similar assignment without the tool?
   -- Was the tool wrong in any place? What did I have to change from its output?



-- About how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment?
2.5


-- (Optional) What was your favorite part of the assignment?



-- (Optional) How would you improve the assignment?
