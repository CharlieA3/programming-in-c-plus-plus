-- In the WordArray constructor that takes a charater array as an argument, how did you split the string into words?
I used strtok. I knew since this modified the original string I needed a copy. I would use strtok to count words and used the other copy of 
the const char* to get each token and add it to the m_array.


-- How did you append the words from one array onto another?
I checked if I needed to reallocate, then copied from the m_array of this class and the src depending on the indexing. Then since I used 
new to create a temporary dynamic array, I had to delete it and everything in it. I then set everything in this class to the array i populated
and the max words and number of words. If I did not need to reallocate (or the original could hold everything), I just looped through duplicating the
words and updating the number of words it was holding.


-- Did you find valgrind useful on this assignment?
yes, I ran into a lot of seg faults or invalid reads/writes becaause of faulty logic which I used valgrind to help me with
