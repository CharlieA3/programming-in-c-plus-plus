VALUE 1: m2 = 505

- placed a breakpoint at line 42 (mystery2() function call) 
- Under the "watch" tab, I put in the variable "m2"
- Since mystery2 is only activated when the input is not an integer, I used the continue operation to first get to the cin part
- Entered "hello"
- step into the mystery2 function
- continue, which then reaches the exception
- m2 is now displayed in the watch tab
- record the value, stop the program


VALUE 2: m1b = 34

- set breakpoint at mysteryb1
- added valued m1b to watch tab 
- press play
- continue operation, enter integer "4"
- set breakpoint at line 22 (while (mystery1a(i)))
- continue until I get to i=10
- since I am sitting at the mystery1a function call, it displays the correct mb1 value that is being used becasue it was just assigned the value of z


VALUE 3: i = 19

- set breakpoint at mystery1b
- add i to the watch tab
- add m1b to the watch tab
- set breakpoint at line 21 (i--, should stop before executing this line)
- continue
- enter "4"
- step into
- continue until I see m1b for the second time
