-- How did you handle strings that are not the same length in strcmp?
I knew that I could use a while loop to get to the point where one or both strings reached the null termination byte. Once that was reached, I could just check the indices using the size_t variable
I made to see if the index that was stopped at was the same for both, or I could just compare them to see if one of the strings terminated and the other didn't. If there was a string that was longer,
it would have a larger value so comparing them would return the correct value;


-- How did you search from the end of the string in strrchr?
I initially did it in a way that started at the front of the string and just found the last instance of the character if there was one, but I changed it to increment a size until null byte was reached,
then looped backwards looking for the character.


-- How did you look for a substring in strstr?
I had a while loop that would increment the index, check if the first index of string 2 was equal to the current index, if so, then loop through the length of that string (if we can) to see if that actually matched.
If it did not match, move one.

no



-- Did you use any LLM tools? If so, what tool, and what prompts did you provide?
no



-- If you used an LLM tool, write a sentence or two reflecting on your use of the tool. Some prompts that might help you think:
   -- Did the tool aid in my learning, or was it just a shortcut around challenges?
   -- With what I've learned, could I complete a similar assignment without the tool?
   -- Was the tool wrong in any place? What did I have to change from its output?
