-- Have you used other unit testing frameworks before?  If so, how does CxxTest compare?
I ahve used pytest before and its annoying. I like CxxTest better, it just feels simpler. I think C++ is my favorite language because
of how versatile it is. Testing is simple, but to go on a tangent I, I could use it for so many different things like games, embedded systems
optimization engineering at a trading firm, writing hardware emulators for new computer architecture, etc. Anything cool really.


-- Were there any functions that you found difficult to test? How did you get coverage for them?
The assignment copy and move operations were difficult to test at first because I wasn't understanding how lines were missing.
I realized that I wasn't systemcatically thinking through each function to make sure every possible condition was met. Once I asked
myself if each line would be ran from my code, it was pretty much the same difficultly for each case and function. The copy and move 
assignment still had the most extra lines that I had to add when I realized it wasn't fully covered.


============================================================

-- Did you use any external resources? If so, cite them below. If not, write no.
Class resources.



-- Did you use any LLM tools? If so, what tool, and what prompts did you provide?
no


-- If you used an LLM tool, write a sentence or two reflecting on your use of the tool. Some prompts that might help you think:
   -- Did the tool aid in my learning, or was it just a shortcut around challenges?
   -- With what I've learned, could I complete a similar assignment without the tool?
   -- Was the tool wrong in any place? What did I have to change from its output?
n/a



-- About how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment?
8


-- (Optional) What was your favorite part of the assignment?
Learning how to actually write test suites. I will keep this code for me as a template for how to set up testing suites because 
any job will probably want me to know how to write tests.


-- (Optional) How would you improve the assignment?
I think it is good.
