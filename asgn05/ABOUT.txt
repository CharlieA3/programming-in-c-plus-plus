-- How did you make the Shape class abstract?
I made the contructor and destructors empty, and made the destructor and the other member function besides the constructor
virtual or pure virtual. Making a class with pure virtual functions basically doesn't allow it to be instantiated becasue the functions 
aren't implemented. When you implement them for derived classes, it will not allow you to instantiate that object until all the pure virtual
member functions are implemented as well.


-- What was different about the functions you implemented for the [] operator on Vector2D?
I used the throw keyword to throw an out of range exception if the index's given were out of the range we wanted. They 
were also the only functions that took in integers for the Vector2D class.


-- How did you pass arguments into the stream operator functions?
I passed in a reference to an output stream becasue I assumed you would want to modify a more global output stream that is being used
by your program and might be used by other functions. I also passed in a const Vector2D reference because I wanted to avoid the overhead
of copying a variable for the scope of the function, but I also wanted to guarantee that the vector would not be modified and 
read from only.


============================================================

-- Did you use any external resources? If so, cite them below. If not, write no.
I used lecture notes and excercises on the overrides and the class material.



-- Did you use any LLM tools? If so, what tool, and what prompts did you provide?
I did not.


-- If you used an LLM tool, write a sentence or two reflecting on your use of the tool. Some prompts that might help you think:
   -- Did the tool aid in my learning, or was it just a shortcut around challenges?
   -- With what I've learned, could I complete a similar assignment without the tool?
   -- Was the tool wrong in any place? What did I have to change from its output?
n/a



-- About how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment?
3.5


-- (Optional) What was your favorite part of the assignment?
learning the ambiguities of implementing all the overrides and the abstract class. So basically the whole thing, I feel like I learned a lot.


-- (Optional) How would you improve the assignment?
