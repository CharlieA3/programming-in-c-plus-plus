-- What was the issue in circle.cpp and how did you fix it?
The issue was that tests were failing because answers were off because of rounding. I fixed this by changing the precision to 3 instead of 2.


-- What was the issue in hello.cpp and how did you fix it?
The issue was that the hello program was not printing out any name. This fix was to add the name variable into the cout chain instead of the "".


-- What was the issue in numbername.cpp and how did you fix it?
The issue was program failure when entering the number 3. The fix was to add 3 to the switch case.
