# Assignment: Setup



## Overview

In this assignment you will get set up with tools for the
course, edit basic programs, and run their test cases.

Starting from the provided repository, which includes starter code, reference
implementations, and test cases, complete three programs
in C++.

Requirements:
* Complete the three programs listed below by filling in their respective .cpp files.
* Follow the course Development General Guidelines.

Restrictions:
* n/a

Editable files:
* Any cpp file.



### hello

This program prompts the user to enter their name, and then reads their name as a line from standard input.

If there is an input error, the program prints "Invalid input."

Otherwise, it prints "Hello, [name]!" to standard out.



### numbername

This program reads one integer N from standard input.

If N is <= 0 or >= 4, or there is an input error, the program prints "Invalid input." to
standard error and exits.
      
Otherwise, it prints the name of the number to standard out.



### circle

This program prompts the user to enter a circle's radius and reads one double X from standard input.

If X is < 0 or there is an input error, the program prints "Invalid input." to
standard error and exits.
      
Otherwise, it prints the diameter, circumference, and area of the circle, with 3 digits of precision, to standard out.
