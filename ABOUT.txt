-- What did you think of the Red Blob pathfinding tutorial?
It was really helpful to visualize the algorithms using the animations because it made it easy
to understand the order of operations.


-- Why did we need to define operator< for Point and PriorityPoint?
to order points properly we used the <operator for points
To make it a min heap instead of a max heap for priority point.


-- Which did you prefer implementing, BFS or A*, and why?
I liked BFS because it is simple, A* kinda got confusing and it doesn't seem that much better than BFS. If I were making a game though,
I probably would give different AI different pathfinding algorithms to make things interesting.

class notes and such


-- Did you use any LLM tools? If so, what tool, and what prompts did you provide?
no


-- If you used an LLM tool, write a sentence or two reflecting on your use of the tool. Some prompts that might help you think:
   -- Did the tool aid in my learning, or was it just a shortcut around challenges?
   -- With what I've learned, could I complete a similar assignment without the tool?
   -- Was the tool wrong in any place? What did I have to change from its output?
n/a



-- About how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment?
6
