-- How different were the implementations for different collection types?
Since Vector and List have similar function and different under the hood operations, those function were the same. The one
that was different was map because it has a different structure and a different method of traversal so that had to be used. 
Since it was different you can use the iterator in a different way.


-- Why do you think compare_main should search for a word not in the collection?
To test all the lines of code.


-- Do you prefer C++20 or C++98?  Why?
C++98 I think is a little more revealing with how things work so as long as you know how to read C++ it is not that bad but more informative.


============================================================

-- Did you use any external resources? If so, cite them below. If not, write no.
course slides and example code



-- Did you use any LLM tools? If so, what tool, and what prompts did you provide?
no


-- If you used an LLM tool, write a sentence or two reflecting on your use of the tool. Some prompts that might help you think:
   -- Did the tool aid in my learning, or was it just a shortcut around challenges?
   -- With what I've learned, could I complete a similar assignment without the tool?
   -- Was the tool wrong in any place? What did I have to change from its output?




-- About how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment?
5.5


-- (Optional) What was your favorite part of the assignment?



-- (Optional) How would you improve the assignment?
