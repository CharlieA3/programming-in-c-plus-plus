-- What type of exceptions did you throw and why?
I used runtime excpetions because I thought that would be most applicable. All of the errors occur during runtime
from a misinput form a file or not reading the file or a incorrectly configured world.


-- Why does this assignment use getline rather than operator >>?
It uses getline because we need to read the entire line including spaces. The >> operator would stop at whitespace


-- How did you check for a win or lose?
I checked if any of the robots were in the same position as the player, if so the player loses. I checked if there were no robots or only one debris
and if so the player wins. If neither of those the player is still playing
