-- How did you display two fixed digits of precision in median.cpp? What might be an alternative approach?
I used the setprecision function as well as the fixed function before it. An alternate could be to use printf with the format function?


-- What data types did you use in frame.cpp and why?
I ised size_t so I could properly compare values. size_t is unsigned so I kept everything the same type when using the .size function so I could compare.


-- How did you ignore additional input on lines in grid.cpp?



============================================================

-- Did you use any external resources? If so, cite them below. If not, write no.

2.5


-- Did you use any LLM tools? If so, what tool, and what prompts did you provide?
I did not use any LLM tools


-- If you used an LLM tool, write a sentence or two reflecting on your use of the tool. Some prompts that might help you think:
   -- Did the tool aid in my learning, or was it just a shortcut around challenges?
   -- With what I've learned, could I complete a similar assignment without the tool?
   -- Was the tool wrong in any place? What did I have to change from its output?
n/a
